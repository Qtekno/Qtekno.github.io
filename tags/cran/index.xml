      <description>â€œR is a scripting language for statistical data manipulation and analysis. It was inspired by, and is mostly compatible with, the statistical language S developed by AT&amp;amp;T.The name S, obviously standing for statistics, was an allusion to another programming language developed at AT&amp;amp;T with a one-letter name, C. S later was sold to a small firm, which added a GUI interface and named the result S-Plus. (Norman Matloff, The Art of R Programming)</description>
